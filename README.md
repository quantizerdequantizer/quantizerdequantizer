This repository contains the Verilog implementation of our proposed hardware modules in our [IISWC paper](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~ml2au/papers/IISWCFinalVersion.pdf), which proposes a method for transparent quantization and dequantization between L2 and L1. 
The full descprition of required metadat used by our hardware mdoules is in the [Full_description_of_metadata](Full_description_of_metadata) folder.
